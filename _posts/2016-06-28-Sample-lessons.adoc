= Sample lessons

/////
Sample annotated lesson plans -- avoid posting links to PDF versions of your favorite lessons plans. Nobody has time to read through entire documents. Instead, write a short paragraph explaining some of your favorite and most successful classroom activities. Include student feedback if possible, pictures or screenshots, and a link to the lesson plan itself at the end of your description.
