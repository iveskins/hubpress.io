Here is some of the things I have been up to recently. +
I have been asking my students questions using a google form. Then I have been giving them answers with a google sheets plugin called FormMule. I made a nice html/css email template to that takes a students answer and my response and puts them together.

My students asked for exam preparation so I made them a fancy memrise course. I scanned all the vocabulary from our textbook. sent the words to google translate to get voice recordings, the Japanese meaning and the English pronunciation. I used a script to automatically save images for each of the words from google image search.
I used another set of scripts to upload that all in bulk to Memrise.

For my studies I have to Japanese texts above my level. I integrated a furigana project with google translate. Now I can some Japanese text and make a document with furigana, and translations of chunks for English.
