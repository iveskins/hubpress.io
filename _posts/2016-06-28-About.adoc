My name is *Ivan Timbrell*. 
//I am *New Zealand*. 
//Our cottage was full of books, and my family was always reading. 
//From a young age I was very *excited by language* and its power to create different worlds. 
//I was also lucky enough to study *Te Reo Maori*, the native language of New Zealand. 
//As a teenager I became fascinated with Japanese language and culture. 
//I enrolled in *University* to study *Japanese language and Asian studies*, but I switched to *Media Studies* later. 
//I gave up on my language studies at university, but I didn't give up on my love of languages, and my goal to speak more than one language. 
//In *2014* I moved to *Tottori Japan* to teach as an *ALT* on the *JET program*. I am currently working and studying towards a *masters degree in education* at Tottori University in Japan. 

At *University* studied *Japanese language and Asian studies*, and *Media Studies*. 
In *2014* I moved to *Tottori Japan* to teach as an *ALT* on the *JET program*. Later I recieved a *masters degree in education* from the graduate school of Reigonal Sciences at Tottori University. 

//In *2014* I moved to *Tottori Japan* to teach as an *ALT* on the *JET program* and to try to learn Japanese. I am currently working and studying towards a *masters degree in education* at Tottori University in Japan. 

//Two of the things I most love about teaching English overseas are,  
//first, *making new friends* and building a sense of *community* and meaningful relationships with many people 
//and, second, being part of an *exchange of cultures* and ideas in all their forms, helping others to learn and *learning* a lot about myself. +
