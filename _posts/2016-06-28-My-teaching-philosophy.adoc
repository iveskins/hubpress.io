= My teaching philosophy


I am still learning as I go along, but there are some themes that seem to make sense for me as a teacher.
To summarize.

- Holistic 全体的 -- Learning should be connected to life, context, and personality  
- Empathetic 共感 -- I care(too much maybe?) about the people I am helping
- Social 社会 -- Learning is a social process. Knowledge is socially constructed and used, so it should be learned socially
- Independent 独立 -- The most empowered individual is one who has learned how to teach themselves.
- Fun -- Learning shouldn't be a chore. Fun isn't always without learning.   
- Respect 尊敬 -- I respect my students, and I want them to respect themselves and their fellow learners.
