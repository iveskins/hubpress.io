= Adding static pages to a hubpress blog.
:hp-tags: Tech, This blog, Web, Code, HubPress, Blog, 

I wanted to used this blog to host some static information about me.
My problem was that I couldn't see a way to add static pages or additional navigation buttons to the pages. +
To do this I needed to edit 
the file: *iveskins.github.io/themes/uno-zen/partials/aside.hbs* + 
I added a new list of links to the file after the existing list.
There is a list item for each static page I want. I simply use links to blog posts with the relevant titles to make static pages.


          <nav class="navigation left">
            <ul class="links">
             </li>
              <li class="nav-about ">
               <a href="https://iveskins.github.io/2016/06/28/Sample-lessons.html">Sample / サンプル</a>
             </li>             
            </ul>
          </nav>
